# Fractals

- A fractal is generally ‚Äúa rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reducedsize copy of the whole‚Äù, a property called self similarity.

- This game involves the generation of 1 koch snowflake. To create a koch snowflake, we start with an equilateral triangle and replace the middle third of every line segment with a pair of line segments that form an equilateral "bump".

## Objective
- Calculate the perimeter of the resulting snowflake in each iteration for the given length of equilateral triangle
